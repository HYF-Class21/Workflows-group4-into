## Instructions:

Here are the steps we needed to do to complete this project:

- On `Github`:
  - Used `template-markdown` repo as a template for creating.
    `workflows-group4-intro` repo.
  - Protected the `main` branch (Settings -> Branch protection rule).
  - Added team members (Settings -> Collaborators and teams) and assigned all as
    `Admin`.
  - Enabled `Github` pages (Settings -> Pages).
  - Created a `Project` on `Github`.
  - Created `Issues` for the project and linked them to the project.
- On `VSC`:
  - Each team member cloned the repo to his machine, installed npm packages,
    created their own branch and made their own `bio.md` file.
  - Ran all check commands.
  - Added files to the `Staging Area`.
  - Commit the changes with meaningful message.
  - Pushed the changes to `Github` and made `Pull Request`.
